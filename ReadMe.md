#Project Summary



The "analysis_report" file is about all the tool choice, code used and thought process. The "tripdata_manipulation is the cleaning and manipulation process as the name might suggest. The Datasets used are referred inside the "analysis_report" file, since it is almost 1 GB of files. But if you want to download the files just go [Here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

It is worth to say that the data still being updated every month so I might come back here to see if there were any changes about tendencies and conclusions, besides that, it is a good parameter for myself to compare how my approach to that data was, and how I'd do it some time in the future.

If you want to clone this repository and try it out by yourself, it is a good thing to set your script inside the same folder of the csv's files, but only if you want to execute the code without any changes.

üòç Any feedback will be appreciated since my goal is to learn more and more everyday! üòç
